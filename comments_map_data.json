For that to happen, there is a need to employ required competent teachers for each language.\nWithout teachers , it would be impossible to learn the third chosen language.

It may be just a medium of communication for you, but for us, it’s our identity, our culture, and our pride.\n\nIndia is a strong nation because of its diversity. It is a union of states — not because of Hindi, but because of the unity among various languages, cultures, and traditions. Hindi is not the national language; it is just one of the many Indian languages. When Hindi is imposed on us, it feels like our own language, culture, and identity are under threat.\n\nWe don’t want to learn a third language. A two-language policy — Kannada and English — is enough for us. You may ask, why learn English, a British language, but not Hindi, an Indian language?\n\nThe truth is, India as a single political entity came into being only because of the British. Without them, this land would have remained a subcontinent of many kingdoms, cultures, and languages — and that’s not something to be ashamed of. It’s our history.\n\nWe learn English because it opens global opportunities, helps us get better jobs, and improves our future. But what do we gain by learning Hindi? For most of us in the South, nothing. It doesn't help us professionally or socially. So why should we be forced to learn it?\n\nIf we don’t speak, preserve, and promote our language, who will?

When someone says “charity begins at home,” it’s not an act of selfishness—it’s a foundation. Likewise, embracing Kannada in Karnataka isn’t an act of defiance, it’s an act of identity, of rootedness, and from that rootedness comes the strength to embrace others.\n\nThe beauty and challenge of India lie in exactly this: unity through plurality. And that makes this tension deeply Indian—because few other countries carry the weight of so many languages, faiths, and traditions within one border. So yes, this friction is almost unique to India, but it’s also one of its greatest philosophical strengths: the constant balancing act between honoring the local and embracing the national.\n\nSuggesting that not speaking Hindi makes someone unpatriotic is a narrow view of a vast and layered nation. In fact, it may be more patriotic to defend linguistic diversity—because that’s the soul of India. Just as justice starts next door, and charity at home, patriotism begins with love and respect for one’s own corner of the nation.\n\nIndia, after all, didn’t become a republic of one identity—it became a federation of many. That’s not a flaw. That’s the design.",
