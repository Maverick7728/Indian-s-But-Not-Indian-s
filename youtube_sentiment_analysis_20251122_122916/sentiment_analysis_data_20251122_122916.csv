What’s Fueling India’s Language Wars ? | Vajiram and Ravi,Vajiram and Ravi Official,"It is natural—both intuitively and logically—for those who have deep love for the country - to think in favor of a common link language to support national integration.
Just as we have one Constitution, one national flag, national animal, bird, fruit, and game, a shared language can also unify the country.

Myth:  Learning other language would make one lose his cultural identity.
1)	Our food habits have changed over time. We eat foreign foods and beverages which are not a part of our tradition and culture. Did we lose our culture?
2)	Our clothing styles have changed. Does that mean we have lost our culture? 
3)	We started celebrating or at least accepting other religious festivals like Christmas, Eid etc., Did that spoil our culture?  
4)	Foreign Music, dances and literature are being shared and enjoyed. Did that make our culture a lost one? 
5)	Now we have modern education. We go to schools and colleges. Did all this make our culture lost? 
6)	We are using modern modes of transportation, using modern electronic gadgets. Did that destroy our culture? 
7)	We are learning English as a compulsory subject. Did that destroy mother tongues? 
8)	Many students and job seekers learn other foreign languages like French, germen etc. Did they lose their mother tongues? 
9)	If any of the activities – so connected to cultural values – have not changed or deformed our cultural identity, how come learning a language like Hindi would make one lose one’s cultural identity?  

Myth: Hindi is difficult to learn. 
1)	Among all Indian languages, Hindi has the highest number of commonly shared words (Of course via Sanskrit).  Hence, less effort is required to learn new words. 
2)	Hindi grammar is simple and is like simple arithmetic which anybody can learn within a couple of months. Grammars of classical languages like Sanskrit and Tamil are harder to learn. 
3)	Hindi, like any other language in India has similar sentence structure ie Subject+ Object + Verb pattern. Like any other Indian language, the word order is of not much significance, giving more freedom in usage. 
4)	Hence, translation from mother tongue to Hindi is easier than English.
5)	Instead of linguistic purism, Hindi can adopt words from all Indian languages to make its pan Indian and enriched vocabulary. 

Myth: Additional burden
1)	During our school days, subjects like computer science, programming, or AI didn’t exist. But today’s children learn these new subjects with ease. Similarly, introducing a subject like language learning—which boosts brain function—would be highly beneficial for them, and just as easily they would be adopted. 
Fact: Hindi is easier to implement  
1)	Hindi is already spoken by about 43.63% of the total population. This makes Hindi the most common first language in India. 
2)	Approximately 57% of the Indian population, can speak Hindi or a closely related language. This makes Hindi the most commonly known and spoken language in India.
3)	Hindi is also the third most spoken language in the world. 
It would be difficult if anybody starts from the scratch. 

Avoiding the study of Hindi is often driven by politics and the fear that it might overshadow regional languages. But we already study all subjects with English as medium of instruction, and English isn’t most people’s mother tongue. Unless somebody purposefully decides not use one’s mother tongue, it would not perish. So, what real harm would there be in accepting Hindi as a common link language? This is a question every educated Indian should ask and honestly get answers from within.

- English is taught in all schools.
- It can act as ""tool"" between states and 70-90% of countries.
- It is also taught in 90% of the asian/europian and 70% of the african/s.american countries.
- The time used for teaching Hindi or any other language, can be used to teach:-
1) In-depth of mothertongue.
2) Professional fluency in it.
3) Good spoken English.
4) More Science or Maths
5) More detailed History & Geography native to the state.
6) More Practicals, Arts and Games
- Learning little bits of 3+ languages, wont make a person expert in any of them, unless you live in the area where those languages are spoken

India is a strong nation because of its diversity. It is a union of states — not because of Hindi, but because of the unity among various languages, cultures, and traditions. Hindi is not the national language; it is just one of the many Indian languages. When Hindi is imposed on us, it feels like our own language, culture, and identity are under threat.

We don’t want to learn a third language. A two-language policy — Kannada and English — is enough for us. You may ask, why learn English, a British language, but not Hindi, an Indian language?

The truth is, India as a single political entity came into being only because of the British. Without them, this land would have remained a subcontinent of many kingdoms, cultures, and languages — and that’s not something to be ashamed of. It’s our history.

We learn English because it opens global opportunities, helps us get better jobs, and improves our future. But what do we gain by learning Hindi? For most of us in the South, nothing. It doesn't help us professionally or socially. So why should we be forced to learn it?

What’s Fueling India’s Language Wars ? | Vajiram and Ravi,Vajiram and Ravi Official,"National Integration: Imposing Hindi undermines unity by alienating non-Hindi speakers and threatening diverse identities, despite Hindi itself being a relatively new language it has destroyed languages that have existed for centuries longer.

Administrative Uniformity: English already ensures administrative unity; forcing Hindi creates more disruption and inefficiency in other state governments. Union Government must focus on macro unifying policy and not be imposing singular language and religion, they should focus on education, defence, healthcare, all these critical parameters India is lagging almost 20-30 years behind China.

Population Logic: Hindi is not a majority language; imposition marginalizes diverse regional tongues like Awadi, Haryanavi, foreshadowing the linguistic suppression feared by the South.

Cultural Nationalism: Political imposition of Hindi fuels anger and backlash. Every state in south has Hindi Prachara sabhas and in most schools Hindi is taught at least optionally, do not impose, attract people into the language don't minimise another language. Also even Sanskrit makes more sense than Hindi if you want cultural ""nationalism"", 30% of Hindi is Persian, are we going to follow dead Persian culture now?

Maithili is still recognized as a separate language in the Constitution. What about the rest? Buried under “Hindi” for political convenience. North India didn’t just adopt Hindi, it lost its own voices to it...

Maithili is still listed separately in the Constitution, why not the others? Because they were sidelined, not because they were dialects. North India didn’t just embrace Hindi, it unknowingly let go of its own linguistic roots.

That story portrayed us how Churchill was a winner and a visionary man. I didn't know the whole truth about Churchill until I started digging about colonial India and the British empire back then. At this point of time, I was roughly 20 years old (during lockdown).

Imperial Receipts with Dr Shashi Tharoor | Episode 1: The Empire,Dr. Shashi Tharoor Official,"I think we need to be a little more nuanced and careful with the facts than is done here by the eloquent Dr. Tharoor. If it is biased to one side, an informed person can embarrass us when we share this. 

1) Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 at St. Mary's Hospital in London, where he worked as a bacteriologist. He got the Nobel Prize for this in 1945. He came to India only in 1953, 2 years before he died. 

2) As for education, the two centers mentioned most often - Nalanda (Bihar) and Taxila (modern day Pakistan) - were non-existent for centuries. Historian D.N. Jha from the University of Delhi mentions that the Buddhist center Nalanda was destroyed by 2 Hindu monks in the 12th century, while Taxila was abandoned in the 5th century. What is now IIT Roorkee was set up by the East India Company's Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, James Thomason as the first engineering institution in India in 1847. It was to help train people to build the Ganges Canal, and named by Proby Cautley as the Thomason College of Civil Engineering in 1854.


3) As for the size of the economy, it should be noted that the industrial revolution started ~1750 in England. Per Nobel laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in Why Nations Fail, mechanization affected workers in England (as much as anyone else), many of whom revolted (the Luddites) to destroy machinery. It is therefore a tad too convenient to say the British rule destroyed the Indian economy to its own gain. While the Indian economy definitely suffered due to many policies of the EIC, a natural experiment to consider is the comparison of India and China, the two largest economies in 1700. One was ruled from 1757 by the EIC, and the other never was. Both fell in economic size. It indicates that the British rule could not be the factor. In fact, a tiny portion of China ruled by the British - Hong Kong - went on to be 27% (per the World Bank) of the size of the entire Chinese economy in 1993.",@navinmathew,English,"{'compound': -0.8869, 'positive': 0.048, 'negative': 0.075, 'neutral': 0.877, 'sentiment': 'negative'}",All India,-0.8869,negative,0.048,0.075,0.877

Agreed that:

The British raped India, enriched themselves beyond belief, killed and maimed Indians,  created famine that killed millions, looted the country for 200 years.

Mr Taroor, that unfortunately , is what occupying forces do.

And where is your superlative tongue when you are part of Indian political junta when they are currently looting India, dividing india, creating chaos beyond belief, making the poor die etc ?

Have you swallowed your tongue? 

Fight what is happening in India NOW instead of raking up issues for you to shine in front of Gullible Indians as though you are fighting their cause.

Imperial Receipts with Dr Shashi Tharoor | Episode 1: The Empire,Dr. Shashi Tharoor Official,"Dr Tharoor is used to lecturing an audience completely untutored in the history of British India and consequently is confident that his pastiche of nationalist myths and invented British atrocities will be believed. I however, have studied Indian history and this video did not impress me - except for the audacity with which he tells stories that he himself knows are absolute tommyrot. His version of history consists of a series of assertions, without argument or proofs. For instance his recollection of the history of the British railway system is almost completely false. Indians benefited directly because it was built by Indian labourers who were well paid. Indians took advantage of the railways immediately to travel to visit relatives and to make pilgrimages with a convenience, speed, and a cheapness of travel never before imaginable: the advantages to Indian culture were incalculable. Indians were not herded into rail cars like cattle, on the contrary, the British designed cars especially to accommodate the rules of caste. 3/4 of Indian passengers travelled for free, by riding on the roofs of the rail cars, it is surprising they made a profit. By the 1880s the rail network penetrated to almost every minor town with a market, which allowed the average ryot access to overseas markets for his rice or cotton and average agricultural income increased by 18%.. The same network allowed the British govt to move food in bulk rapidly, and to combat famines effectively for the first time in Indian history - under the Mughal Empire no attempt was made to deal with famine, they just let the peasants die. By 1947 there were 19,000 miles of railways in India, while in China there were less than 4000 miles. Tharoor avoids mention of the vicious social oppression inherent in the caste system, or the many social atrocities connected with both Hinduism and Islam; such as purdah, sati, child marriage, female infanticide, and human sacrifice. The British were very reluctant to legislate against deep seated Indian customs which they personally found repugnant; they believed that fair government had no place interfering in indigenous custom or religion. Thus it was not until the 1820s that female infanticide was abolished, the 1860s that sati was abolished, both passed against the strenuous opposition of the Hindu establishment. It was not until 1910 that a law was passed forbidding the consummation of a marriage with a girl under the age of 12 years; an ancient custom that all members of the Indian Congress, including Gandhi, approved of. For Tharoor to claim that these gross cultural enormities would have been eradicated sooner or later by Indians themselves, ignores the fact that when these practices were suppressed by the British, the most influential and powerful Indians of the time fought tooth and nail to preserve these customs. Tharoors' claim that the Indian economy in 1650 produced 25% of the world GDP but had sunk to only 2% by 1900 ""because the British had looted India of trillions"" is another lie: the actuality is that since 1650 Europe's capitalist economy had expanded rapidly by 800%, while India's traditionalist economy had stagnated at the level of 1650. Modern India owes everything to British colonial rule. No amount of propaganda by India's historical community - the laughingstock of the world - can change that.

Imperial Receipts with Dr Shashi Tharoor | Episode 1: The Empire,Dr. Shashi Tharoor Official,"Well Tharoor fails to tell you most of what Britain gave to India. Madras, Calcutta, Bombay. The transformation of the economy from a medieval to a modern capitalist economy: with Indian merchants solely dominating the interior trade and Indian merchants  sharing in the coastal/port trade. The creation of a money economy replacing a barter economy. Commercial innovations like the Corporation, joint stock companies, limited liability, sinking funds, national bank, national debt, stock exchange. The substantial expansion of the textile industry by creating a vast overseas market in Europe, Indonesia, Japan. Peace throughout the whole of India for the first time in history, which brought security and thus increased economic activity.  Newspapers, printing, the railway system, vast irrigation canal systems in the Punjab and Gangetic Plain (largest canal system in the world), the telegraph and telephone system. The first universities (free tuition). The unification of the whole peninsula into a single political unit for the first time. The establishment of the ""fixed rent or tax"" per acre throughout India, which curtailed rack-renting by Indian landowners (all taxes and rents were directly collected by wealthy Indians, NOT BY THE BRITISH THEMSELVES). The first government efforts to combat famines, which  with the railway system, became effective for the first time in history. The first census. The first scientific survey of the whole country. The gradual abolition of some of the medieval practices of Islam and Hinduism, female infanticide, sati, the consummation of marriage with child brides under the age of 12 yrs. The end of centuries of invasion of the north half of India by barbarians from Afghanistan, Ubekistan, Persia. The reason why India in 1947 was the most industrially advanced nation in Asia after Japan was, that the British introduced the beginnings of modern industry in the 1880s, such as steel smelters and mills near Bombay, steam cotton-weaving mills at Bombay, steam ship construction and steam navigation - all being British-Indian partnerships. A vast input of capital from England for commercial investment. The Indian Army, which spread the cash nexus to small villages where the sepoys sent their money home. The first codification of Mughal law into a system. The establishment of a nation wide judicial system based on English common law and some Hindu and Muslim customary law, which for the first time in history gave equal justice to every Indian no matter what their caste, including the 25% outcastes. The rescue of Sanskrit and the Vedas, and the Bagavad Gita from complete oblivion, their publication and their teaching, and the complete rejuvenation of Hinduism in the 1800s as a result. Modern medicine, hospitals, mass vaccinations.

The rule of modern English law, which allowed Gandhi and the National Congress the freedom to lead mass political demonstrations and protest strikes legally.

In place of so-called leaders of many opposition parties who are considered to be worthy of primeministership, he is the one who has all qualities of at least, considering of being prime minister candidate. 

Till now, I talked about the credentials of what he will probably never be taken into consideration for by his own party. 

Anyways, coming back to the point, I have read his book called ""An Era Of Darkness"" inspired by his own speech at Oxford Union, though, few additions have been done which due to boundation of sticking to the topic at Oxford Union, couldn't be made. 

Based on this, I can believe upon his information regarding british exploitation, depredation and loot of Bharat. 

With all due respect, sir should also be considering islamic infiltration, attak in northern India as part of their dream to transmogrifying whole world in islamic state or islaminizing whole world.

Imperial Receipts with Dr Shashi Tharoor | Episode 1: The Empire,Dr. Shashi Tharoor Official,"Sorry but Dr Tharoor also knows that he has been unnecessarily blowing this , a book and then a celebrated speech probably were not enough. Couple of points. British and the east india company were not a philanthropic set up and came here to make money. Few points : they never exceeded a couple of lakhs and we participated in crores to support them. All of police and admin was india, including all the brutal killings, lathi charge, 1857s inhuman punishment to Jallianwala bagh, all done by our own. Why would somebody not expose these? Anyway now most are dead. Second there would have been no india as a nation if they would not have united us. Of course they united us for their own commercial purpose but our leaders grabbed it. Else we would have had these multi sized kingdoms fighting like cats and dogs. Third we were lucky that we had British , less savage than the Dutch, French, Spanish, Belgians or even Japanese or Russians. They were cruel but not like these.  Fourth they gave us modern institutions, and we can’t blame all creations for exploitation. Geographically survey of india , ASi , post office, and so many others. Now one can’t say all these were to exploit our country. Some may have but flip side was far more beneficial to us. Why did all the great kings not establish these ? Some like Jaipur did. Bit too small to have an impact and here and there. They gave us the modern law, wasn’t there . They could have done easily  without it. They were ruling. Even for semblance of civility and order they did , was of immense use to us. And we had many good judges and many good Judgements. Many are quoted even today. They brought us modern education and English. Else we would have been good at our religious and cultural studies but not fit for the modern world. Look at China for example. I can go on and on. My point is they were here to exploit our resources. We did not have the power , unity or the will to fight them. Post Shahjahan those were lost centuries. Don’t see a point blaming looters.

Imperial Receipts with Dr Shashi Tharoor | Episode 1: The Empire,Dr. Shashi Tharoor Official,"A Western-friendly aesthetic deployed to “westernize” an Indian agenda gains nothing from the ceremonial apology of a monarch of a bygone empire. The British crown—irrelevant now except as pageantry—was never so “formal” in life as it is in its afterlife, embalmed in sentiment and ritual. To demand apology from such an institution is to lend it renewed legitimacy, to clothe it in a dignity it scarcely merits.

Tharoor’s reliance on cherry-picked examples—forgets post-colonialism, the “slowness” of modernization in but a few railway corridors—reduces history to anecdote. The railways, built for the English and not the Indians, were no gift, but neither were they useless. Their present decrepitude is not a colonial inheritance but the fruit of corruption, bureaucracy, and decades of neglect. To suggest otherwise is not simply misinformed; it is recklessly bold, as though India were incapable of reasoning except through the paternal voice of the colonizer. And so, when his arguments collapse under the scrutiny of open platforms, what remains is tone-deaf, logically indefensible, as light as air muslin cloth that fiber by fiber will untangle due to the lack of substance in things lacking anything 'dense' Muslin – truly a nice pick for someone whose wisdom is as airy and light. Whether he takes the dismantling of his logic as calamities of the most grievous order in stride, absorbing them with the air of a Stoic philosopher rather than a vengeful and howling Banshee, we'll see. Personally, he isn't learned enough to understand anything but I contrasted it with howling Banshees because asking for a formal plea just sounds like the opposite of wisdom and howling banshees, just like they don't exist, neither does what God put between his ears. My mum called it 'Common sense' but I think there is so little of it in his dome, I'd like to rename it 'Rare'",@ArwenAreYouOK,English,"{'compound': 0.9187, 'positive': 0.123, 'negative': 0.079, 'neutral': 0.798, 'sentiment': 'positive'}",All India,0.9187,positive,0.123,0.079,0.798

So marathi people automatically understand & learn hindi without any classes . But that is not the case with hindi region people. They think all indians know hindi and if they don't , then they should. They think they are superiors over other non-hindi people. 

For instance , when I went to Tirupati I used hindi as medium to talk , however some people find it insulting and they told me whether talk in their language or in english but not in hindi. I took lesson and next time I used some basic telugu words , people felt very happy and help me ,even used cracked hindi. Its all about giving respect to others , their culture and not insulting them .That's why guy from mira road (mumbai) got beaten up . Look at his attitude . It shows everything . he was intentionally insulting and pretending like newbie there like he doesnt know anything about where he lives , in what language people daily talk over there, even though he knew marathi .

You would have faced much more consequences for such a behaviour & arrogance if you were in any of the South Indian states like Karnataka.

Maharashtrian Marathi people have always accommodated & supported people coming from all over the Indian states .But now due to the uncontrolled inflow of these people & the arrogance of some against our locals language / culture , now  the issue has arrived of insecurity amongst our local population .
It is always better to adapt to the local language & culture wherever you go , because you came here for better opportunity & for your benefit ,hence YOU have to adjust to our culture so that these incidences do not occur in future.

Language War Explodes: Hindi Imposition vs The Idea of a Diverse India | Democratic Newsroom,India Today,"how can love for one’s country be authentic if it doesn’t include love for one’s roots—language, culture, and community? When someone says “charity begins at home,” it’s not an act of selfishness—it’s a foundation. Likewise, embracing Kannada in Karnataka isn’t an act of defiance, it’s an act of identity, of rootedness, and from that rootedness comes the strength to embrace others.

The beauty and challenge of India lie in exactly this: unity through plurality. And that makes this tension deeply Indian—because few other countries carry the weight of so many languages, faiths, and traditions within one border. So yes, this friction is almost unique to India, but it’s also one of its greatest philosophical strengths: the constant balancing act between honoring the local and embracing the national.

Suggesting that not speaking Hindi makes someone unpatriotic is a narrow view of a vast and layered nation. In fact, it may be more patriotic to defend linguistic diversity—because that’s the soul of India. Just as justice starts next door, and charity at home, patriotism begins with love and respect for one’s own corner of the nation.

That's the population more than the 5th largest country in the world. Majoritarianism never works for the national unity. If English is foreign to you, which you seem to know anyway, Hindi is foreign to South Indians!  Remember , for most part of the history these were separate kingdoms(Whenever these states were part of the common India, countries like Afghanistan was also part of the common nation)!

Now, there are many Indian languages in the top 20 spoken world languages, be it Bengali, Telugu, Punjabi, Marathi, Tamil ..any of them could be the linked language. Would you like it? the difference in percentage is not that great. Would you consider Bengali as Indian language? If you combine with the population of Bangladesh, it's not that different from Hindi when compared against the number of people who know the language.

If you must form a link language, start teaching Manipuri or Naga to everyone, so nobody is really at an advantage!

I am from South India, and have learnt Hindi in school, got 100% marks in 10th. Still I cannot form a sentence right in Hindi, same with everyone i know.

Language War in India | How it Hurts the Nation ? | By Aadesh Singh | StudyIQ IAS,StudyIQ IAS,"भारत की राष्ट्र-भाषा “हिन्दी” नहीं; “भारतीय” होनी चाहिए।

हम “हिन्दू” नहीं, “सनातनी हैं, “हिन्दुस्तानी” नहीं, “भारतीय” हैं; तो फिर हमारी राष्ट्र-भाषा भी “हिन्दी” नहीं कहलानी चाहिए। जिस प्रकार, इंग्लैंड की राष्ट्र-भाषा का नाम ‘इंग्लिश’ है; इसी प्रकार से भारत की राष्ट्र-भाषा का नाम भी “भारतीय” होना चाहिए। 
भारत वासियो! यह सर्वमान्य सत्य है कि भारत के प्राचीन पंथ/धर्म का नाम ""सनातन"" है: ""हिंदू"" नहीं। इसी प्रकार से, हमारे देश का प्राचीन नाम ""भारत"" है: ""हिंद"" या “हिंदुस्तान” नहीं। 

हमारे पंथ को ""हिंदू"" नाम तथा हमारे देश को ""हिंदुस्तान"" नाम: विदेशी आक्रांताओं, आक्रमणकारियों ने दिए थे। विदेशी आक्रांताओं का लंबे समय तक भारत पर शासन होने के कारण; यह दोनों नाम प्रचलित हो कर प्रसिद्ध हो गए और हम भारतवासियों ने भी, इन दोनों नामों को सही समझ कर, इन का उपयोग करना आरंभ कर दिया; जो कि पराधीनता (गुलामी) का चिन्ह है। इस लिए, राष्ट्र-भाषा को “हिन्दी” कहना: अयोग्य है। 

यदि हम “हिंदू” नहीं: “सनातनी” हैं, हम “हिंदुस्तानी” नहीं: “भारतीय” है; तो हमारी राष्ट्र-भाषा भी ""हिंदी"" नहीं कहला सकती। हमारी भारतीयों की राष्ट्र-भाषा का नाम तो ""भारतीय"" ही होना चाहिए। जिस प्रकार, जापान की राष्ट्र-भाषा का नाम ‘जापानी’, रूस की राष्ट्र-भाषा का नाम ‘रूसी’ है तथा अरब की राष्ट्र-भाषा का नाम ‘अरबी’ है; इसी प्रकार से भारत की राष्ट्र-भाषा का नाम भी ‘भारतीय’ होना चाहिए। 
“हिंदी” भाषा तो हिंदुस्तानियों की हो सकती है, भारतीयों की नहीं। 

जब हमारे देश का मूल वास्तविक नाम ‘हिंदुस्तान’ ही नहीं: तो हम भी ‘हिन्दुस्तानी’ नहीं; हम तो भारतीय हैं। जिस प्रकार विदेशियों ने हमें “हिंदू” और हमारे देश को “हिंदुस्तान” नाम दे दिया, उसी प्रकार से उन्होंने हमारी भाषा को भी “हिंदी” नाम दे दिया। विदेशी आक्रांताओं ने हमें, जो भी गलत नाम दिए (भारतवासियों में स्वाभिमान न होने के कारण), हम ने उन गलत नामों को ही स्वीकार कर लिया। 

आज हम भारतीय स्वतंत्र हैं। इस कारण, हमें विदेशियों के दिए हुए इन नामों को त्यागना चाहिए। सभी भारतीयों को मिल कर, एक नई “भारतीय” भाषा बना लेनी चाहिए, जिस में  भारत से उपजी, भारतीय मूल की सभी भाषाओं के शब्द सम्मिलित हों। 

(“भारतीय मूल की भाषा” का अर्थ है: जिन भाषाओं की शब्दावली तथा लिपि, भारत से उपजी हो; जैसे: संस्कृत, तमिल, तेलुगु, उड़िया आदि।) सभी भारतीय भाषाओं के अधिकतर शब्द, पहले ही आपस में मिलते हैं जैसे: दया, धर्म, करुणा, गुरु, नगर, शास्त्र आदि। इस कारण, सभी भारतीय भाषाओं के शब्द मिला कर, एक नई भाषा बनाने में कोई समस्या नहीं हो सकती; अपितु, भाषा की अधिकतर समस्याओं का समाधान हो जाएगा। केंद्र सरकार को, उसी नई भाषा को ‘भारतीय’ नाम दे कर; राष्ट्र-भाषा घोषित कर देना चाहिए। अभी तो भारत सरकार के सभी केन्द्रीय सचिवालय तथा न्यायालयों में, प्रत्येक कार्यों में अंग्रेजी का उपयोग होता है। 

जब सभी प्रांतों में तथा जनता में नई “भारतीय” भाषा प्रमाणित स्वीकारित हो जाएगी, तो अंग्रेजी की बजाय “भारतीय” भाषा का प्रयोग आरंभ हो जाएगा और हम गुलामी के चिन्ह ‘अंग्रेजी’ से छुटकारा पा सकेंगे।
ऐसा करने से, दक्षिण प्रांतों की तमिल, कन्नड़ आदि कुछ भाषाओं के जो हिंदी के साथ झगड़े हैं; वह भी पूर्ण रूप से समाप्त हो जाएंगे। क्योंकि, उन की भाषाओं के शब्द भी, नई भाषा में सम्मिलित हो कर, “भारतीय” भाषा का अटूट अंग बन जाएंगे। 

“भारत” देश, ""भारतीय"" भाषा: यह दोनों नाम उपयोग कर के, भारतीयों में आत्म सम्मान आएगा और एकता होगी। एकता से ही भारत की उन्नति होगी। इस प्रकार से, सभी भारतीय भाषाओं के शब्द मिला कर बनी नई “भारतीय” भाषा; राष्ट्र की उन्नति में अत्यंत सहायक होगी। इस लिए, भारत को नई ""भारतीय"" भाषा बना कर, अपना लेनी चाहिए। नई ""भारतीय"" भाषा का बना कर अपना लेना; भारत को ""विश्व गुरु"" बनाने की दिशा में एक महत्वपूर्ण कार्य होगा।

Language War in India | How it Hurts the Nation ? | By Aadesh Singh | StudyIQ IAS,StudyIQ IAS,"It's easy to call Hindi-speaking states ""poor"" or ""underdeveloped"" without understanding the centuries of history that led to it.

Northern India acted as the frontline of defense for the entire subcontinent for centuries—facing repeated invasions, wars, and destruction from Central Asia, Mughals, and the British. Cities like Delhi, Varanasi, Mathura, and Nalanda were attacked and rebuilt countless times.

In contrast, Southern states remained relatively untouched by invasions and thus had the chance to heal and grow earlier. Their development is admirable, no doubt—but it doesn't mean the North is “lazy” or “backward.”

After independence, North India provided massive tax revenue and manpower to the nation, including the armed forces. But political instability, population burden, and post-partition trauma slowed its recovery.

Before judging the North, learn the full picture. Development is not a race—it’s a shared journey. India grows best when every region respects and supports the other.

सभी तरह की परीक्षायें हिंदी भाषी राज्य हिंदी में करें और अहिंदी भाषी राज्य अपनी मातृ भाषा में करें.जो प्रशासनिक अधिकारी अंग्रेजी जाने उसकी पोस्टिंग दक्षिण भारत के राज्यों में की जा सकती है.जो प्रशासनिक अधिकारी दक्षिण भारत के हैं अगर वे हिंदी नही भी जानते हैं उनकी पोस्टिंग हिंदी सिखाकर उत्तर भारत में की जा सकती है.भाषा के नाम पर भारतीयों के बीच खाई पैदा हो रही है.
जब मैं गोरखपुर वायु स्टेशन में पोस्टेड था तो एक बंगाली वायु सैनिक ने बंगाली मेडिकल आफिसर से बंगाली भाषा में बात करना चाहा.उस मेडिकल आफिसर ने उसे रोकते हुए कहा कि वायु सेना की भाषा अंग्रेजी और हिंदी है और तुम सिर्फ हमसे अंग्रेजी या हिंदी में ही बात कर सकते हो.

You YouTubers often say that Hindi-speaking people are right and Kannada people are wrong. But the only solution to stop this fight is to respect each other, communicate properly, and stop spreading hate.

1. Show me even 1% of Hindi-speaking people who have lived in Karnataka for more than 5 years, made homes here, taken local jobs, and at least tried to speak five sentences in Kannada. Most don’t even make the effort.

2. Is it right for an SBI employee to have an arrogant attitude toward customers who don’t know Hindi or English?

3. How could Sonu Nigam compare the Pahalgam attack to Kannada? That was one of the reasons for the outrage. Earlier, he had sung Kannada songs and even performed in Bengaluru—so why can’t he sing again now?

4. I agree some auto drivers behave rudely, and that’s wrong. But at the same time, I can also show you how some people play the “woman card” while holding a camera—there’s another side too, where they use chappals and even get violent.

5. I agree with one point from your video: people should not fight against Hindi. But at the same time, we should also oppose the forced imposition of Urdu.

÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷
- Why to learn any language,
- When not at all needed throughout life,
- Unless you or your parent want.
- English is taught in all schools, not only in India but across the world.
- English will just act as ""tool"" of communication between states and 70-90% of countries.
- English is also taught in 90% of the asian/europian and 80% of the african/american countries.
- The time used for teaching Hindi or any other language, can be used to teach:-
1) In-depth of Mothertongue.
2) Professional fluency in Mothertongue.
3) Good spoken English.
4) More Science or Maths
5) More detailed History & Geography native to the or district or region.
6) More Practicals, Arts and Games
- Learning little bits of 3+ languages, wont make a person expert in any of them, unless you live in the area where those languages are spoken

Can India Have One National Language? Tamil Nadu Refuses Hindi | The NEP Controversy Explained,Vijender Masijeevi,"I don't understand this MF language debate. People who have never read NEP, know nothing about language and history come and dissolve poison in the society.

Under the NEP every child is expected to learn 3 languages, two of which must be indian languages. Usually people learn mother tongue, english and any other indian language (not necessarily hindi). In my case for example, I was tought Nepali(spoken in Sikkim) along with hindi and English. 

People from south  india especially complain that Hindi is being imposed on them, NO IT'S NOT. It's upto states to promote their language. Learn hindi only if it benifits you( though I would recommend since half of the nation speak Hindi). To a Hindi speaker, I would say : try to learn the local language if you ever move to non hindi state, it's not going to harm you, only thing it will do is to aid to your progress.

And if you are not willing to accept this 3 language formula, then India is never going to be united. And slogans such as"" Unity in diversity"" will be meaningless.

Sir here mentioned that Hindi is difficult compared to Dravidian languages and people from south find it difficult to learn it. He may be right but my point is: You are not expected to learn difficult grammer and complex litrature of the 3rd language, just learn enough to have basic conversation.
And Please do not fall into traps of politicians, they will let country to burn for their vote bank. They are going to divide us based on Religion, caste, language and region.

They expressed concerns that people from the South might not be treated equally by those from the North and even considered the idea of a separate country. Unfortunately, some of those fears are proving to be valid today.

Why is it that people from the South are expected to learn Hindi, while many in the North show no willingness to educate themselves? Instead, many blindly follow caste-driven and religious political agendas.

It’s even more hypocritical when some claim that English is a “foreign language” and insist on promoting Hindi, while ignoring the fact that languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam are much older than Hindi.

To those who demand Hindi: why do you educate your children in English-medium schools? Why do you use English for mobile phones, electronics, banking, and IT? If English is so problematic, why is it the backbone of your professional and digital life?

Hindi Imposition Backfires | Regional Parties Double Down On Language Pride | Akash Banerjee & Rishi,The Deshbhakt,"Internal migration across states in India is a natural part of our country's diversity and economic landscape. People from different regions, including the Hindi-speaking belt, often move to other states for better work opportunities. While this movement helps in economic integration, it can sometimes lead to cultural friction when migrants are unwilling to adapt to the local language, customs, or values.

The concern among native residents arises when it feels like their cultural identity is being overlooked or disrespected. Instead of mutual understanding, tensions can grow if newcomers try to recreate their own regional culture without integrating into the local context. It's important for migrants and locals alike to engage in respectful coexistence.

Ideally, state governments should work toward creating balanced development and employment opportunities across all regions. This would reduce the pressure on people to migrate and help preserve local cultures and languages, while still allowing people to work and live with dignity.

In cases where conflict arises, it’s important to examine the root causes rather than relying solely on media narratives. Emotional or biased reporting can sometimes overshadow the underlying issues, leading to further misunderstanding.

Just as people in the UK or other countries express concerns about preserving their native culture amidst immigration, similar sentiments can exist within Indian states. Recognizing this parallel can help foster empathy and promote better dialogue around internal migration and cultural respect.",@sakshipatil7692,English,"{'compound': 0.9842, 'positive': 0.186, 'negative': 0.059, 'neutral': 0.755, 'sentiment': 'positive'}",All India,0.9842,positive,0.186,0.059,0.755
