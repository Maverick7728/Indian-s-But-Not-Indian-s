÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷
- Why to learn any language,
- When not at all needed throughout life,
- Unless you or your parent want.
- English is taught in all schools, not only in India but across the world.
- English will just act as ""tool"" of communication between states and 70-90% of countries.
- English is also taught in 90% of the asian/europian and 80% of the african/american countries.
- The time used for teaching Hindi or any other language, can be used to teach:-
1) In-depth of Mothertongue.
2) Professional fluency in Mothertongue.
3) Good spoken English.
4) More Science or Maths
5) More detailed History & Geography native to the or district or region.
6) More Practicals, Arts and Games
- Learning little bits of 3+ languages, wont make a person expert in any of them, unless you live in the area where those languages are spoken

They expressed concerns that people from the South might not be treated equally by those from the North and even considered the idea of a separate country. Unfortunately, some of those fears are proving to be valid today.

Why is it that people from the South are expected to learn Hindi, while many in the North show no willingness to educate themselves? Instead, many blindly follow caste-driven and religious political agendas.

It’s even more hypocritical when some claim that English is a “foreign language” and insist on promoting Hindi, while ignoring the fact that languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam are much older than Hindi.

To those who demand Hindi: why do you educate your children in English-medium schools? Why do you use English for mobile phones, electronics, banking, and IT? If English is so problematic, why is it the backbone of your professional and digital life?

If people don’t change their mindset and embrace equal respect for all languages and cultures, we may end up facing a real divide between North and South India.",@karthick-kns,http://www.youtube.com/@karthick-kns,0,2025-08-07T06:24:01Z,0,False,,en,English,"{'compound': -0.818, 'positive': 0.056, 'negative': 0.092, 'neutral': 0.853, 'sentiment': 'negative'}",All India,-0.818,negative,0.056,0.092,0.853
